## What the Vandelay Expert Does

The Vandelay Expert is Vandelay's built-in agent builder and platform authority. It helps users:

- Design, create, test, and improve team member agents
- Write and edit member instructions and personas
- Assign and scope tools to the right specialists
- Apply starter templates (14 available personas)
- Set up cron jobs and configure the heartbeat
- Add, remove, and reconfigure team members
- Diagnose underperforming agents (prompt issues, tool mismatches, token overflow)
- Scaffold custom toolkits when built-in tools don't cover a use case
